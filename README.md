The **Augment-Vision-Drone** is a groundbreaking project that introduces a foldable drone equipped with auto-deployment and augmented reality (AR) capabilities. This drone can detect objects of interest and overlay their information onto a VR headset, pinpointing their exact direction and distance, even if these objects aren't in the user's direct line of sight.

## Project Outline

### 1. Auto Deployment
https://github.com/rishikesh2715/Augment-Vision-Drone/assets/72249404/c8a2ea8d-f2c1-446d-b462-615fb7fdb45f

We are in the process of designing a 3D body with spring-loaded foldable arms that can auto-deploy when the drone is thrown into the air. Currently, we are testing our third iteration of the drone body. The initial two iterations have proven that our control algorithm can stabilize the drone regardless of its orientation when thrown. We are optimistic that this iteration of the drone frame will be successful. This phase of the project is ongoing.

### 2. Object Detection Model

This phase involved developing an object detection model that operates seamlessly on the drone. We are pleased to announce that this part of the project has been completed successfully.
We get the live camera feed from the drone video transmitter to a local video reciever that we can connect to a perosnal computer. This method reduces the need to run the computer vision model directly on the drone thus saving a lot of computaional power.

### 3. AR Overlay on VR Headset

The objective of this phase is to overlay the detected object's distance and direction onto a VR headset, ensuring it aligns with a team member's line of sight. This part of the project is still in progress.

### 4. Real-time Telemetry Server
